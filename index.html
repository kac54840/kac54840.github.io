		I'm Kayla, and I work at Plato's Closet!
		Some people dread going to work, but I'm not one of those people!
		I've worked at two Plato's locations spanning the course of the past three years, 
		and I can't imagine Plato's not being a part of my life. In fact, I hope to own my own Plato's one day!

		Working at Plato's Closet is a lot crazier than you would think, and if there's one thing this job has done for me, 
		it's toughen my skin. 
		If you don't know what Plato's is, it's basically a high-end thrift store that pays cash on the spot for trending teen
		and young adult casual styles. Emphasis on <span STYLE="font-style: italic"> trending </span> and 
		<span STYLE="font-style: italic">young adult </span>, so as you can imagine some people don't handle rejection very well.

	There are a lot of crazy things that go on at the Closet. One of my least favorite days was one particular Sunday. It was
	very busy, and one of our computers was down. Then, TWO different people peed in the dressing rooms. It's important to mention
	that they were <span STYLE="font-style: italic"> not </span> children.
